				<h2>April 30, 2019 - The "Flat" Earth from 35,000 Feet</h2>
				<p>
					Casual observers of the "Flat Earth movement" will likely have been puzzled at its seemingly rapid growth in 
					adherents in recent years. For most of those not in the movement, it appears as though the 
					whole thing must be some kind of satire until one digs into the material being presented in many places around 
					the Web, most notably on YouTube. When one spends any time at all consuming this content, even if only out of 
					morbid fascination, one realizes that the movement is not mostly a bunch of internet trolls maliciously purveying 
					misinformation onto the public (though some trolls are certainly within its ranks). Instead, it actually
					includes a large number who sincerely believe that the "globe earth" is a massive conspiracy. They point to
					any number of pieces of evidence to support their theory including views from cruising altitude 
					of airliners that appear to show a flat horizon. I set out to demonstrate why this specific claim does
					not hold up under scrutiny.
				</p>
				<img src="/projects/earth/cockpit.png" style="border: solid 1px"><br>
				<a href="/projects/earth/roundearth.html">Skip straight to my demonstration that shows the curvature flatten
					as you zoom in on an airplane passenger's observable horizon!</a>
				<p>
					It should be noted that it is extremely difficult to find a clean unobstructed view of the horizon.
					Almost all views of the horizon from 35,000 feet are going to contain cloud cover, which makes it difficult
					to simply draw a straight line on the image, and when one does, it generally either "proves" the observer's
					confirmation bias or is easily discounted by the opposing side. For this reason, I am pursuing a different
					approach by asking this question: just how much curvature can we actually expect when viewing the Earth from 
					35,000 feet?
				</p>
				<p>
					The first step to understanding this question is in realizing that while 35,000 feet (6.6 miles) feels
					extremely high to mere humans, it is a miniscule distance above the Earth's surface when compared with the
					Earth's radius, which <a href="https://www.space.com/17638-how-big-is-earth.html">ranges between 3,950 and 
					3,963 miles</a>. Assuming, for the sake of simplicity, that the Earth is a sphere with average radius of
					3,959 miles, this would mean that at cruising altitude, one is at an altitude of only 0.167% of the Earth's
					radius. Based on these two numbers, we can actually calculate the distance to the horizon (among other things):
				</p>
				<img src="/projects/earth/roundearthdiagram.png">
				<p>
					In the image above, which is NOT to scale, the most interesting items to note are the following:
					<ol>
						<li>
							The observer is 6.63 miles above the Earth's surface.
						</li>
						<li>
							At this height, it is 229.1957 miles from the observer to the horizon.
						</li>
						<li>
							That view is virtually the same distance as the 229.1783 mile curve from immediately below the
							observer to the horizon.
						</li>
						<li>
							That 229 mile curve makes only a 3.3&deg; angle with the center of the Earth. In other words, 
							the view extends only 0.92% of the circumference of the Earth.
						</li>
						<li>
							Because the angle with the center of the Earth is so small, this means that the angle from the
							observer to the horizon, at 86.7&deg;, is almost a right angle. And the chord, i.e. the straight
							line that connects the point immediately below the observer with the horizon point, at 88.3&deg;,
							is even closer to being a right angle. <em>This should be a major HINT for how much curvature we
							can expect to see.</em>
						</li>
					</ol>
					Armed with this knowledge, I decided to plot the observer's viewing circle <strong><em>to scale</em></strong> with
					the Earth:
				</p>
				<img src="/projects/earth/1.png" style="width: 70%">
				<p>
					One can see that at 35,000 feet, the observer is seeing only a <strong><em>tiny</em></strong> fraction of the 
					Earth's surface. In fact, it is only 0.084%, not even one-tenth of 1 percent. Taking this a step further, I also
					plotted the observer's altitude of 6.6 miles on the top of that same picture above with the observer's view of the 
					horizon	filled in blue. You probably can't even see it because the altitude is so tiny. However, I have also
					created a <a href="/projects/earth/roundearth.html">tool that enables you to zoom in slowly on this section</a>, 
					which I believe demonstrates just how little curvature one can expect to see from a plane cruising at 35,000 feet. 
					Fully zoomed, the curve below is approximately the curvature that a human with a 
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_view#Humans_and_animals">field of view of 114&deg;</a> could expect 
					to see:
				</p>
				<img src="/projects/earth/highres.png" style="width: 100%">
				<p>
					It is important to keep in mind that the red line represents the farthest right the human eye can see when looking
					forward. So to really get the correct impression, imagine looking straight at the center and zooming in even further 
					until the red line is nearly out of sight on your right hand side. Now, I'll take the blue observer's sight-line away
					as it makes the curve more obvious than it is naturally:
				</p>
				<img src="/projects/earth/withoutblue.png" style="width: 100%">
				<p>
					Finally, the Earth actually curves a bit more gradually than the picture above and there are no pixels on
					the real Earth to make the curve obvious. 
				</p>

					As you can see, despite in fact being a globe, the Earth appears quite flat from 35,000 feet!

				<h2>March 25, 2019 - March Madness - Sweet Sixteen Update</h2>
				<p>
					As many of you reading this are likely aware, last year I wrote a program that simulates March Madness.
					I started this purely in an effort to make it easier for me to fill in my 25 ESPN Tournament Challenge
					brackets in a reasonably intelligent manner. However, after building the script for 25 iterations, I
					thought, "Why not simulate it over a much larger number of iterations and share my results?" So today,
					I have posted my Sweet Sixteen results for 2019. Feel free to peruse the 
					<a href="projects/MMSimulator/SweetSixteen/sweetsixteen.html">results</a> at your leisure, but I thought I would 
					take a few minutes to share with you some interesting observations.
				</p>
				<p>
					First things first, I must say I am pleased with my rankings this year. Whether it is pure luck or there 
					was some level of skill involved, the top 15 of my rankings all made it to the Sweet Sixteen this year.
					While admittedly, much of this is simply due to higher seeds performing very well, you can see below
					that my rankings outperformed the NCAA's seedings with a 5-seed I ranked 14th sneaking in. Admittedly, 
					both the NCAA and my model did not foresee Oregon making it this far. All in all, following a crazy year 
					in which 16-seed UMBC beat 1-seed Virginia, the first time in NCAA tournament history a 1-seed lost 
					in the first round, there have been FAR fewer surprises this year.
				</p>
				<img src="5seed.png">
				<p>
					Speaking of Oregon, because they made it to the Sweet Sixteen, Virginia has, by far, the easiest 
					pathway to the Championship. Otherwise, we're dealing with virtual coin-flips for each game here on out.
					Here are the probabilities for each team to proceed to the next level assuming they make it to a given 
					level:
				</p>
				<img src="virgorg.png">
				<p>
					Regarding conferences, the Pac-12 was disastrous this year fielding only 3 teams (25% of its 12
					teams) to the tourney. Before the First Round started, my model showed only a total 0.5% probability that ANY
					ONE of the 3 Pac-12 teams would make it to the Championship game. To put that into perspective, the MAC
					Conference, which fielded only 1 team (Buffalo) had a 4.2% chance to make it to the final game. (Luckily 
					for Texas Tech, Buffalo's small probability was not realized.) 
				</p>
				<p>
					Unlike the Pac-12, the ACC, which garnered massive hype heading into the Tournament has posted almost
					unbelievably impressive results. It has certainly been enough to silence the doubters (like I admittedly 
					was). The ACC fielded a very respectable 46.7% of its 15 teams to the First Round, but <em><strong>astonishingly</strong></em>
					5 of the 7 ACC teams initially fielded (33.3% of the conference) are headed to the Sweet Sixteen. On the
					other side of that same coin, the Big 12, which led the NCAA with 60% of its teams making it to the First
					Round, has largely disappointed and now only has one hope to win it all, my alma mater, Texas Tech. #WreckEm
					#4to1
				</p>
				<img src="ConfPerf.png">
				<p>
					Finally, the last observation I'll share is that I REALLY hope my bracket #s <a href="/projects/MMSimulator/14.png">14</a> and 
					<a href="projects/MMSimulator/17.png">17</a> both picked the incorrect champion! ;-) With that, I'll leave you 
					with some links if you'd like to explore the results of my simulation even further:<br>
