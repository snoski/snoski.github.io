			<h3>March 25, 2019 - March Madness - Sweet Sixteen Update</h3>
			<p>
				As many of you reading this are likely aware, last year I wrote a program that simulates March Madness.
				I started this purely in an effort to make it easier for me to fill in my 25 ESPN Tournament Challenge
				brackets in a reasonably intelligent manner. However, after building the script for 25 iterations, I
				thought, "Why not simulate it over a much larger number of iterations and share my results?" So today,
				I have posted my Sweet Sixteen results for 2019. Feel free to peruse the 
				<a href="MMSimulator/SweetSixteen/sweetsixteen.html">results</a> at your leisure, but I thought I would 
				take a few minutes to share with you some interesting observations.
			</p>
			<p>
				First things first, I must say I am pleased with my rankings this year. Whether it is pure luck or there 
				was some level of skill involved, the top 15 of my rankings all made it to the Sweet Sixteen this year.
				While admittedly, much of this is simply due to higher seeds performing very well, you can see below
				that my rankings outperformed the NCAA's seedings with a 5-seed I ranked 14th sneaking in. Admittedly, 
				both the NCAA and my model did not foresee Oregon making it this far. All in all, following a crazy year 
				in which 16-seed UMBC beat 1-seed Virginia, the first time in NCAA tournament history a 1-seed lost 
				in the first round, there have been FAR fewer surprises this year.
			</p>

				Speaking of Oregon, because they made it to the Sweet Sixteen, Virginia has, by far, the easiest 
				pathway to the Championship. Otherwise, we're dealing with virtual coin-flips for each game here on out.
				Here are the probabilities for each team to proceed to the next level assuming they make it to a given 
				level:

			<p>
				Regarding conferences, the Pac-12 was disastrous this year fielding only 3 teams (25% of its 12
				teams) to the tourney. Before the First Round started, my model showed only a 0.5% probability that ANY
				of the 3 Pac-12 teams would make it to the Championship game. To put that into perspective, the MAC
				Conference, which fielded only 1 team (Buffalo) had a 4.2% chance to make it to the final game. (Luckily 
				for Texas Tech, Buffalo's small probability was not realized.) 
			</p>
			<p>
				Unlike the Pac-12, the ACC, which garnered massive hype heading into the Tournament has posted almost
				unbelievably impressive results. It has certainly been enough to silence the doubters (like I admittedly 
				was). The ACC fielded a very respectable 46.7% of its 15 teams to the First Round, but <em><strong>astonishingly</strong></em>
				5 of the 7 ACC teams initially fielded (33.3% of the conference) are headed to the Sweet Sixteen. On the
				other side of that same coin, the Big 12, which led the NCAA with 60% of its teams making it to the First
				Round, has largely disappointed and now only has one hope to win it all, my alma mater, Texas Tech. #WreckEm
				#4to1
			</p>

				Finally, the last observation I'll share is that I REALLY hope my bracket #s <a href="/projects/MMSimulator/14.png">14</a> and 
				<a href="projects/MMSimulator/17.png">17</a> both picked the incorrect champion! ;-) With that, I'll leave you 
				with some links if you'd like to explore the results of my simulation even further:<br>
