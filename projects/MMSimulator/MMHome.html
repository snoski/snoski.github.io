			<p>
					Every year in March, millions of basketball fans get amped for the thrill that is March Madness. Many will fill out brackets online hoping
					 to hit pay dirt if they can achieve the ever elusive <em>perfect bracket</em>.
			 </p>
			<p>
					Some websites allow many entries, but each entry takes quite a bit of time to fill out if one is trying to think thoughtfully about the real probabilities of all of the teams winning their respective games. For instance, ESPN's <a href="https://games.espn.com/tournament-challenge-bracket/2018/en/">Tournament Challenge</a> allows each user 25 brackets. At 63 games each, this means a user would have to determine the winner for 1,575 games!
			</p>
			<p>
					This year, I decided to write a program that would automatically fill out my 25 brackets based on given win probabilities. I thought, while I'm at it, why not run it over 100,000 iterations and analyze the results? Below you can see what I discovered.
			</p>
			<p>
					For those of you asking why in the world I would want to do this or wondering if 100,000 iterations is overkill: <a href="why.html">Why?</a>
			</p>
			<p>
					For those of you that want to dig far deeper into exactly how I did all of this, you can read more about my methodology here: <a href="methodology.html">Methodology</a>
			</p>
			<p>
					But for those of you who are already saying, &#34;Get on with it, and show me the results!&#34;, I will make you wait no longer:
