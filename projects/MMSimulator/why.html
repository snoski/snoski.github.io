			<h1>Why simulate the March Madness tournament over so many iterations?</h1>
			<h2>Here are 4 good reasons:</h2>
			<p>
				<ol>
						<li>
							While skill is obviously important, luck also has a significant role to play in the result of the NCAA men's basketball tournament. This is especially true when the event is only held once. If the right string of coincidences (however unlikely) were to occur even a 16-seed team could win. (Think: top 2 star players on each opposing team gets injured.) However, if one were to replay the tournament over and over again, luck would decrease as a factor and skill begins to show through. By looking at the teams who tend to win more often over a large number of iterations, we can see who has the most skill AND who perhaps has the easiest pathway to the championship.
						</li>
						<li>
							Seeing how infrequently the best team wins despite significant skill demonstrates just how unpredictable this tournament really is. It's why we all love it so much!
						</li>
						<li>
							While 100,000 iterations seems like a huge number, the actual number of possible brackets (excluding the First Four games) is 9,223,372,036,854,775,808. That is 9.223 quintillion. While including win probabilities significantly reduces the number of <em><strong>reasonable</strong></em> brackets, the number is still quite huge. In fact, DePaul professor, Jeff Bergen estimates the chances of a perfect bracket even including quite a bit of nuance is stilll 1 in 128 billion. Given this extremely large population, 100,000 iterations is still a very small sample size when attempting to better understand the population. See Professor Bergen's video below.
						</li>
						<li>
							Finally, running a simulation gives us yet another thing to talk about around the water cooler! Especially when we mix in the ever-provocative discussion of over or under-rated conferences, this simulation will provide plenty of fodder for discussion as we enjoy March Madness.

			<h2>More Discussion</h2>
			<p>
					Let's say you had a team that was going to play 5 games straight, each with different opponents. If it lost any of the games, it would not proceed to the final game, but if it got all the way to the 5th game and won, it would be the champion. (Let's ignore, for now, who would be champion if our team was knocked out.) Let's say the probabilities of our team winning each game (independent of the results of the other games), if it gets to play that game, were as follows (so that competition gets much tougher in the last 3 games):
			</p>
			<p><em>#1: 98%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#2: 75%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#3: 50%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#4: 50%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#5: 50%</em></p>
			<p>
					The probability of our team winning the championship is easy. Just multiply all of those probabilities together, and you get 9.2%. In fact, we can know the probability that our team will make it to AND win each game by multiplying the cumulative probabilities, which looks like this:
			<p>
			<p><em>#1: 98%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#2: 73.5%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#3: 36.75%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#4:  18.375%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#5:  9.1875%</em></p>
			<p>
					Now, if we run a simulation, there is a 2% chance that our team would lose in the very first iteration. This is actually true in the real world, too. However, if that were to occur there's no way you'd say the best team won. Perhaps it would be most accurate to say the best team TODAY won.  Because if that game were played 99 more times, our team most likely would win 98 of those matches.  The same is true for the rest of the series. Thus, over many many many iterations of a simulation, the outcomes inevitably gravitate towards the probabilities.
			</p>
			<P>
					So if we know what the probabilities are and enough iterations eventually gravitate to the probabilities, why run the simulation? Why not just calculate the probabilities and be done with it?  
			</p>
			<p>
					OK, well imagine that the opponent our team plays in the 2nd game is decided by the opponent's OWN first round game. Let's call the favorite in that game &#34;Opp1&#34; and the underdog &#34;Opp2&#34;. Opp1 has an 80% chance of beating Opp2. If Opp1 beats Opp2 then our team has only a 50% chance of beating Opp1, but if Opp2 surprisingly wins in the first round, our team has an 80% chance of beating Opp2. The probabilities then look like this:
			</p>
			<p><em>
					80% chance:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#1: 98%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#2: <strong>50%</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#3: 50%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#4: 50%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#5: 50%, which multiplied together equals 6.125%<br />
					20% chance:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#1: 98%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#2: <strong>80%</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#3: 50%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#4: 50%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#5: 50%, which multiplied together equals 9.8%<br />
					So if we take (0.8 * 6.125) + (0.2 * 9.8) we get a probability of reaching the final game of 6.86%
			</em></p>
			<p>
					We can see that the outcome for our team DEPENDS on the outcome of the other game in the first round. Now imagine that there aren't only 4 teams playing to the 5th game, but rather <span style="font-size: 20px"><strong>64</strong></span> teams playing to a <strong>6th</strong> round game.  Now you see how complicated the mathematics would be.  Thus, it simply is easier to run a simulation that gravitates TOWARDS the probabilities rather than calculating them.
