			<h1>Why simulate the March Madness tournament over so many iterations?</h1>
			<h2>Here are 4 good reasons:</h2>
			<p>
				<ol>
						<li>
							While skill is obviously important, luck also has a significant role to play in the result of the NCAA men's basketball tournament. This is especially true when the event is only held once. If the right string of coincidences (however unlikely) were to occur even a 16-seed team could win. (Think: top 2 star players on each opposing team gets injured.) However, if one were to replay the tournament over and over again, luck would decrease as a factor and skill begins to show through. By looking at the teams who tend to win more often over a large number of iterations, we can see who has the most skill AND who perhaps has the easiest pathway to the championship.
						</li>
						<li>
							Seeing how infrequently the best team wins despite significant skill demonstrates just how unpredictable this tournament really is. It's why we all love it so much!
						</li>
						<li>
							While 100,000 iterations seems like a huge number, the actual number of possible brackets (excluding the First Four games) is 9,223,372,036,854,775,808. That is 9.223 quintillion. While including win probabilities significantly reduces the number of <em><strong>reasonable</strong></em> brackets, the number is still quite huge. In fact, DePaul professor, Jeff Bergen estimates the chances of a perfect bracket even including quite a bit of nuance is stilll 1 in 128 billion. Given this extremely large population, 100,000 iterations is still a very small sample size when attempting to better understand the population. See Professor Bergen's video below.
						</li>
						<li>
							Finally, running a simulation gives us yet another thing to talk about around the water cooler! Especially when we mix in the ever-provocative discussion of over or under-rated conferences, this simulation will provide plenty of fodder for discussion as we enjoy March Madness.
